In this project, we created a music management system using C. For this system, we used the data in the spotify2023.csv file, which contains the most streamed songs on Spotify in 2023. This file captures essential details such as track name, artist name, release year,energy-danceability-accousticness-instrumentalness-liveness-speechiness percentages and streaming statistics. Using these datas, we have prepared 9 operations that the user can perform. These operations are:
1. Show the song with the highest streams in the year given
2. Show the song with the lowests treams in the year given
3. Add songs
4. Remove songs
5. Search byy ear
6. Search bya rtist
7. Search by name
8. Get suggested song
9. Create playlist

You can execute the code with the following command:
./music_manager
